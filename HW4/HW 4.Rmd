## Functions chapter Problems
#Function Components
1.What function allows you to tell if an object is a function?
What function allows you to tell if a function is a primitive function?

2.  This code makes a list of all functions in the base package.

objs <- mget(ls("package:base"), inherits = TRUE)
funs <- Filter(is.function, objs)
Use it to answer the following questions:

2a. Which base function has the most arguments?

2b. How many base functions have no arguments? What’s special about those functions?

2c. How could you adapt the code to find all primitive functions?

3. What are the three important components of a function?

4. When does printing a function not show what environment it was created in?

#Lexical Scoping

1. What does the following code return? Why? What does each of the three c’s mean?

c <- 10
c(c = c)

2. What are the four principles that govern how R looks for values?

3. What does the following function return? Make a prediction before running the code yourself.

f <- function(x) {
  f <- function(x) {
    f <- function(x) {
      x ^ 2
    }
    f(x) + 1
  }
  f(x) * 2
}
f(10)

#Function Arguments
1. Clarify the following list of odd function calls:

x <- sample(replace = TRUE, 20, x = c(1:10, NA))
y <- runif(min = 0, max = 1, 20)
cor(m = "k", y = y, u = "p", x = x)

2. What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?

f1 <- function(x = {y <- 1; 2}, y = 0) {
  x + y
}
f1()

3. What does this function return? Why? Which principle does it illustrate?

f2 <- function(x = z) {
  z <- 100
  x
}
f2()

#Special calls

1. Create a list of all the replacement functions found in the base package. Which ones are primitive functions?

2. What are valid names for user-created infix functions?

3. Create an infix xor() operator.

4. Create infix versions of the set functions intersect(), union(), and setdiff().

5. Create a replacement function that modifies a random location in a vector.

#Return Values

1. How does the chdir parameter of source() compare to in_dir()? Why might you prefer one approach to the other?

2. What function undoes the action of library()? How do you save and restore the values of options() and par()?

3. Write a function that opens a graphics device, runs the supplied code, and closes the graphics device (always, regardless of whether or not the plotting code worked).

4. We can use on.exit() to implement a simple version of capture.output().

capture.output2 <- function(code) {
  temp <- tempfile()
  on.exit(file.remove(temp), add = TRUE)

  sink(temp)
  on.exit(sink(), add = TRUE)

  force(code)
  readLines(temp)
}
capture.output2(cat("a", "b", "c", sep = "\n"))
## [1] "a" "b" "c"
Compare capture.output() to capture.output2(). How do the functions differ? What features have I removed to make the key ideas easier to see? How have I rewritten the key ideas to be easier to understand?
